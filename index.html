    </body></section>
        <p>As a designer, I strive to nurture and contribute to environments and groups that in turn cultivate innovation, growth, and understanding amongst all individuals involved. Being able to bring peopleâ€™s distinct ideas to life continually drives me to never stop learning. Working together in diverse teams and overcoming new and intricate problems only helps to bolster my desire to learn and grow. My goal is to make meaningful and impactful designs that are accessible and useable for as many people as possible.</p>
